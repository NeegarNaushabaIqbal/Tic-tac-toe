# Tic-tac-toe
This tic-tac-toe project was inspired from Ania Kubow's tic-tac-toe video.
After going through the video, I recreated the project from scratch.
I also added a reset functionality along with a tie indicator which informs the users in case there is a tie.
The reset and tie functionalities were not a part of the video. I implemented them myself.
